Welcome to the documentation for Erebot_Module_IrcTracker!
==========================================================

Erebot_Module_IrcTracker is a module for `Erebot`_ that keeps track of users:
what users are currently present on the same channels as the bot, what is their
status on those channels, etc.

This module can keep track of users across short disconnections using a set
of timers and a smart algorithm that can detect nickname takeover attempts.
