"This module provides a way to track users through nick changes and "
"miscellaneous other events based on their initial nickname. It is meant to "
"help other modules build nick-independent features (such as a game capable of "
"tracking players, no matter how much they change their nickname)."
msgstr ""
#
msgid ""
"This is achieved by associating a token with each user. This token can later "
"be used to retrieve information about the corresponding user (nickname, "
"identity, hostname, etc.)."

"This module also keeps a list with the address of every known user (called "
"IAL in mIRC's terminology, for \"Internal Address List\"). This IAL can be "
"queried in the same way tokens can."

"Moreover, this module keeps information on the different channels users have "
"joined where the bot is also present. This information can be queried to "
"determine if a particular user is present on a given channel. It can also be "
"used to retrieve a list of common channels between some user and the bot."

"Last but not least, this module tracks user status on channels and can be "
"used to find all operators on a channel, the modes affecting a given user on "
"a channel, etc."
